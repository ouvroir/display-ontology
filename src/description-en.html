### Namespace

The namespace for the Display ontology terms is `https://w3id.org/display#`.

The suggested prefix for the Display ontology namespace is `bot`.

### Ontological core and metadata

Version 0.1.0 of the Display Ontology is an ontological core for describing exhibition topology.
Currently, it does not explicitly provide a way to record metadata for exhibitions and exhibits.
Metadata for entities described using this ontology could be expressed through a CIDOC CRM application profile, which requires further discussions.
The exemplar dataset currently follows the Linked Art application profile patterns.

The core of the Display ontology is based on few classes:
the `display:Exhibit` class and the `display:ExhibitionSpace` class.
The main assumption is that a `display:Exhibit` instance is located somewhere within or at the boundaries of a `display:ExhibitionSpace` instance, and that `display:Exhibit` instances can be described by the means of the topological relationship between them or between a `display:Exhibit` instance and a `display:ExhibitionSpace` instance.

In order to achieve this proposition, the Display ontology relies on two core elements:

- the topology of the exhibition space: an alignment with the Building Topology Ontology (BOT)
- the topological relationship of exhibits: a set of object properties loosely based on RCC8-like terminology, describing the topological relationship of exhibits

### The topology of the exhibition space

The Display Ontology is aligned with BOT for the basic description of relations between the sub-components of a building [Rasmussen2020].
There are two specializations to manage exhibition space:
The `bot:Space` class is specialized by a `display:ExhibitionSpace` subclass, which is designed to describe exhibition spaces and inherits  BOT’s properties for generic mereological relationships.
The `bot:hasSpace` property is specialized by the `display:hasExhibitionSpace` sub-property.

The `display:Exhibit` class and the properties that enable exhibits to be located in `display:ExhibitionSpace` are defined in parallel with `bot:Element` and its corresponding properties, which also allow for locating things in space but are semantically incompatible with the concept represented by `display:Exhibit`.
The branches of this parallel pattern are merged through the `bot:Element` class, which is a subclass of `display:Exhibit`.
It allows to share topological and mereological relations at the model level.

For consistency, the phrasing used to describe Display classes and properties for the exhibition space generally follows the linguistic patterns of the Building Topology Ontology’s classes and properties.

### The topological relationship of exhibits

BOT is limited to the description of adjacency, partition and intersection relations, lacking a generic framework for topological relationships.
Display defines the topological relationships of exhibits that are used to describe relations observed between the elements of an exhibition.

An exhibit can be anything located within or at the boundaries of an exhibition space.
The relationship between exhibits forms a set of object properties whose terms are loosely based on RCC8-like terminology [Randell], describing the topological or mereological connections between exhibits.
It is designed to provide some degree of flexibility in descriptions, allowing for the creation of abstract topological statements that are close to natural language while remaining as unambiguous as possible.

The phrasing used to describe topological relations relies heavily on the RCC8 implementation of the GeoSPARQL standard for its clarity, but there is no formal connection between GeoSPARQL and Display.

### Release notes

Version `0.1.0-alpha` of this ontology is an unstable work in progress.
It is the result of the first reflections and experimentations of the research team dedicated to the modelling process.

Entities marked with term status “testing” are actively used in some experimentations conducted at the Ouvroir laboratory.

Entities marked with term status “unstable” are likely to be deprecated in future versions of this ontology and may be removed at any time.
