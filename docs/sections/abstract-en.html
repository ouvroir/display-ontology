<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Display Ontology is intended to describe in an explicit and formal way the features of an exhibition or a collection display (proximity and contiguity of the works, vis-à-vis, etc.). It is based on a spatial perspective of the exhibition, allowing the connection between space and exhibit to be formally defined using a topological approach. The project is supported by the University of Montreal and by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Main ontologist: David Valentine. Project manager: Zoë Renaudie (formerly Lena Krause). Scientific director: Emmanuel Château-Dutier.</span>
