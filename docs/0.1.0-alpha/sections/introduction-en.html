Historical research on exhibitions requires the mobilization and exploitation of extensive archival documentation to provide information on the history of collection hangings in art museums.
The reconstruction of exhibition displays, which remains an essential task for understanding historical curatorial practices, is fraught with practical and methodological difficulties due to the partiality of the documentation preserved and the need to deal with heterogeneous sources of information (exhibition views, loan lists, exhibition room plans, expographic or scenographic projects).

This process can greatly benefit from a digital approach that takes advantage of a model independent of any specific visualization technology, allowing issues such as gaps and uncertainties in historical sources to be adressed.
It provides a methodological framework for gathering historical information and formulating hypotheses, leveraging spatial logics to support researchers’ work.

In this context, the Display Ontlogy is intended to describe in an explicit and formal way the features of an exhibition or a collection display (identification of the exhibition, proximity and contiguity of the works, vis-à-vis, etc.).
It adopts an expographic perspective based on the concept of exhibit, mobilizing abstract spatial logics that imply being able to define topological relationship between exhibits within the exhibition space.

This ontology is developed at the Ouvroir Laboratory and is part of the research on New Uses of Collections in Art Museums, a partnership funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada: [https://cieco.co/en](https://cieco.co/en).
