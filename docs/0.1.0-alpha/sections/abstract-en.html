<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Display Ontology is intended to describe in an explicit and formal way the features of an exhibition or a collection display (identification of the exhibition, proximity and contiguity of the works, vis-à-vis, etc.). It is based on a spatial perspective of the exhibition in order to describe the topological relationship between space and exhibit. The project is supported by the University of Montreal and by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Main ontologist: David Valentine. Project manager: Zoë Renaudie (formerly Lena Krause). Scientific director: Emmanuel Château-Dutier.</span>
