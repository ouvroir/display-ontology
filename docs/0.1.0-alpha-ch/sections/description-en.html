The core of the Display ontology is based on very few classes: the `display:Exhibit` class and the `display:ExhibitionSpace` class. The main assumption is that a `display:Exhibit` instance is located somewhere within or at the boundaries of a `display:ExhibitionSpace` instance, and that `display:Exhibit` instances can be described by the means of the topological relationship between them or between a `display:Exhibit` instance and a `display:ExhibitionSpace` instance.

In order to achieve that proposition, the Display ontology relies on two core elements:

- the topology of the exhibition space: an alignment with the Building Topology Ontology
- the topological relationship of exhibits: a set of object properties loosely based on RCC8-like terminology, describing the topological relationship of exhibits

### The topology of the exhibition space

Display relies on the Building Topology Ontology. An explanation of the way Display is connected to BOT. figures and explanation about the phrasing of display classes that are sub-classes of bot.

### The topological relationship of exhibits

Display is inspired by RCC8 and GeoSPARQL. Flexibility in description.

### Exhibition and exhibit metadata

As an ontological core that aims to describe the topology of an exhibition, the Display Ontology does not explicitly provide a way to record metadata at the moment. Metadata of entities described using Display could be expressed using a CIDOC CRM application profile that needs to be discussed further. Use `rdfs:label`.

### Release notes

Version `0.1.0-alpha` of this ontology is an unstable work in progress.
It is the result of the first reflections and experimentations of the research team dedicated to the modelling process.
It is not intended for production usages at the moment.

Entities marked with term status "testing" are actively used in some experimentations conducted at the Ouvroir laboratory.

Entities marked with term status "unstable" are likely to be deprecated in future versions of this ontology and may be removed at any time.
